# Eschool App — UI strings (https://daybrite.dev/docs/localization). Add a locale by dropping a
# sibling folder (e.g. locales/fr/app.ftl) and translating — the generated
# res::locales::install() in src/lib.rs picks up every locale directory by itself.
#
# The appearance and language rows on the Settings page label THEMSELVES from Day's own catalog,
# so there are no keys for them here.

# The Welcome page. `welcome_body` is rendered as markdown, so the emphasis lives here rather
# than in the layout — a translation is free to stress a different word.
# Each paragraph is ONE line: Fluent keeps the line breaks you write, so a value wrapped for the
# editor's margin would be wrapped that way on screen too, mid-sentence.

    Glad you are here. This little app is yours to take apart — every screen in it is a few lines of Rust, and the widgets you are looking at are your platform's own.

    Open **Navigate** for a list you can reorder, edit, and drill into, then resize the window and watch the navigation find a new shape. When you are ready to build something, the guides are at [daybrite.dev](https://daybrite.dev).
