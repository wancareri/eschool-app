//! The app's domain object, and the per-window state that holds one.
//!
//! Everything a window shows is a projection of ONE [`Scene`] — its store, its filter, its
//! selection — so no page owns state and no page has to tell another that something changed.
//! The store is observable PER PROPERTY (https://daybrite.dev/docs/model):
//! `#[derive(Observable)]` turns every field of [`Item`] into a typed accessor, and
//! `scene.items.elem(id).name()` is a two-way binding a `text_field` takes directly — the editor
//! needs no draft signals and no write-back plumbing. Editing a name wakes exactly the readers of
//! that name; the list re-runs only when the collection's SHAPE changes.
//!
//! A `Scene` is per WINDOW, not per app (https://daybrite.dev/docs/state). That is the whole
//! reason it is a struct rather than a handful of `thread_local!` globals: File ▸ New Window
//! builds the same shell a second time, and a global would hand both windows one selection.
//!
//! Persistence is deliberately boring: the whole list is one JSON blob under one `day::prefs`
//! key, written by one coarse subscription in [`Scene::persist`]. That is enough for a starter,
//! survives an Android process death (prefs is disk-backed), and is the piece you are most
//! likely to replace first — swap it for your database and nothing above this file changes.
